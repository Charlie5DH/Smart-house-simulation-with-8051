Smart house components simulation using 8051 Microcontroller in ASM

The system to simulate is a smart house, in which it is intended to control the water level in a tank, access to the interior of the house, the beginning of a possible fire, the interior and exterior lights and the opening and closing of the doors inside the home. Using an 8051 microcontroller programmed in assembly language as part of the graduate program.
